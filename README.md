# Flash-card-project

In this project We've been looking at handling exceptions, using the JSON data format, passing and reading CSVs using pandas, opening and writing to files and a whole lot more.

It's a flashcard program, and it shows you the front and the back of the card. So for example, French, demande. In English means request. After three seconds, the card flips and I can check whether if I knew the right answer.If I got it right I'll press the tick and if I got it wrong. I'll press the cross So it will show another word, so I'll press cross, and that will go back into the deck and it might come up again at some point. If I know any word and press right button the word will be removed from list of words and it will not come again.
